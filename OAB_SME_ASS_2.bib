  abstract = {Investigated sex differences in perceived discrimination and actual effects of various physical characteristics and background factors on starting and later salaries of 859 male and 355 female MBA graduates (aged 24\textendash 61 yrs). Women more often reported experiencing discrimination, identified as general discrimination against women. Fewer men perceived any discrimination. Men who did claimed to be victims of affirmative action programs favoring women and Blacks. Salary data indicated that women earned less than men, even when controlling for work experience. Controlling for prior work experience and year of 1st professional employment, age and height had a positive effect on men's starting salaries, and being overweight, a negative effect. For women, starting salaries were significantly and positively affected by socioeconomic status (SES). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Examined height and academic success using random samples of male faculty and department chairpersons. In Study 1, a random sample of 83 faculty members revealed that academics are taller than the average American of their age and gender. The monotonic trend anticipated between height and academic rank revealed that assistant professors are 1.24 inches taller, associate professors are 1.5 inches taller, and professors are 1.97 inches taller than the average individual of their age and gender. A second study found that 52 department chairmen averaged 2.14 inches taller than others of their age and gender. Viewed from an interactionist perspective, findings corroborate the idea that height is important not in itself, but because it is a predictor of social dominance.

  abstract = {In this article, the authors propose a theoretical model of the relationship between physical height and career success. We then test several linkages in the model based on a meta-analysis of the literature, with results indicating that physical height is significantly related to measures of social esteem (rho =.41), leader emergence (rho =.24), and performance (rho =.18). Height was somewhat more strongly related to success for men (rho =.29) than for women (rho =.21), although this difference was not significant. Finally, given that almost no research has examined the relationship between individuals' physical height and their incomes, we present four large-sample studies (total N = 8,590) showing that height is positively related to income (beta =.26) after controlling for sex, age, and weight. Overall, this article presents the most comprehensive analysis of the relationship of height to workplace success to date, and the results suggest that tall individuals have advantages in several important aspects of their careers and organizational lives.},
